## Bailey Joseph's Stats Blog  


The source code for all articles and the data they need to run can be found right [here (on my Github)](https://github.com/bmjoseph/blogdown_source).   

To skip straight to the source code (the .Rmd files) for each of my articles, follow [this link](https://github.com/bmjoseph/blogdown_source/tree/master/content/post) to the source/post directory. 

Please feel free to email me at bmjoseph@berkeley.edu if you have any questions of if you notice that I've made a mistake.

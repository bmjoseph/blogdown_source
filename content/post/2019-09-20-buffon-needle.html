<p>It figures that Buffon’s needle is one letter away from Buffoon’s needle. You’ve got to be a buffoon to try to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> by tossing needles at a piece of paper. Or you’re me, and you’re an even bigger buffoon because you used <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> to simulate tossing needles at a piece of paper to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
<p>I first learned about Buffon’s needle as a homework problem in one of my stats classes. The setup is as follows:</p>
<p>Throw a needle of length <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> at a piece of paper marked with vertical (or horizontal, it’s symmetric) lines separated by width <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. What’s the probability that the needle crosses one of the lines?</p>
<p>I won’t go through the math here, but in the special case that <span class="math inline">\(l = h\)</span>, it turns out to be <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{\pi} \approx .637\)</span></p>
<p>To do the simulation, I picked a random point for one end of the needle to land, and then a random angle for the direction of the rest of the needle. I realize this is cheating because I choose an angle between 0 and <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi\)</span>, but the idea was to simulate the physical situation of tossing a needle. Nature also lets you use pi as a constant. Oh well.</p>
<p>To visualize this, let’s first look at just a couple tosses. All the implementation code is on my GitHub as usual.</p>

<p>Seven of the ten needles crossed a vertical line, giving us an approximation of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{.7} \approx 2.857\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s try it with a few more needles:</p>

<p>Binomial trials clearly aren’t a very good way to quickly estimate <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, but to verify that it really will converge, let’s plot the estimate of pi after each of 10,000 trials:</p>

<p>It turns out that Buffon was pretty smart.</p>
